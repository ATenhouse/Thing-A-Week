# Thing-A-Week-2
-----
A slightly more adventurous web scrape for second week of ["Thing a Week"](http://codeaweek.tumblr.com/).Written in Python 3 with [SublimeText 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) on OS X v 10.11.2 (15C50).

Initial submission: 10-Jan-2016, ~9PM CST

Goal: scrape the current FXX lineup and check for any standing listings for Simpsons episodes. Some days you just need to know the Simpsons lineup!

Possible future features:
- Scraping against Wikipedia or a Simpsons wiki for episode information, synopsis
- Clear formatting for season, episode designation

Like other projects in "Thing A Week," this script is subject to "tech debt" and future revision. This moreso than others.
